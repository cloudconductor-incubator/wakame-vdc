# Contribute

This article is about contributing documentation. If you wish to contribute code, please read [the development guide](development.md) instead.

If you wish to contribute to this website, you will need to have a [Github](https://github.com) account and be familiar with [Git](http://git-scm.com). You can contribute using Github's [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) system. We will review your contributions and possibly ask you to change around a few things.

This will not be a one-way conversation. We welcome (well argumented and respectful) discussions about what the documentation should be like. Once we're satisfied with your contribution, we will merge it and publish it to the main website.

This site's documentation repository is located here: [https://github.com/axsh/wakame-vdc/docs](https://github.com/axsh/wakame-vdc/docs)

**Tip:** If you want to preview your changes locally, try running [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).
