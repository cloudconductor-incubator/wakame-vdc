## What is Wakame-vdc?

There are a couple of ways you could answer this question.

* Wakame-vdc is a virtual data center. You may have heard of virtual machines. Those virtualize a single computer. What Wakame-vdc does is virtualize an entire data center. More on that on the [Concept](concept.md) page.

* Wakame-vdc is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework. Basically you can set it up and offer server infrastructure *"up in the cloud"*. Users can control Wakame-vdc through a web browser. That means you can for example set up Wakame-vdc and let users rent virtual servers from you. Some of the companies currently using Wakame-vdc do just that.

Wakame-vdc is free open source software. The source is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/axsh/wakame-vdc). Everybody is welcome to contribute to development and the software can be freely distributed. (Within the rules of the LGPL license)

The following companies are currently using Wakame-vdc in production.

* [Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd.](http://www.kyuden.co.jp/en_index.html)
* [National Institute of Informatics](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/)

This guide will teach you how to install Wakame-vdc on your own server. The end result will be similar to the VirtualBox image but since you're installing everything yourself, you will learn much more about the different components that make up Wakame-vdc.
